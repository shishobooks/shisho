# Lists

Lists are user-created collections that let you organize books across libraries. Unlike libraries, which map to directories on disk, lists are virtual groupings you define yourself — like a reading queue, a favorites shelf, or a themed collection.

## Creating a List

You can create a list from the **Lists** page in the sidebar. Each list has a name, an optional description, and a choice between **ordered** and **unordered** mode.

You can also quick-start with a built-in template:

- **To Be Read** — An ordered list for tracking your reading queue
- **Favorites** — An unordered list for books you love

## Ordered vs. Unordered

**Ordered lists** let you arrange books in a specific sequence using drag-and-drop. This is useful for reading queues or ranked lists where position matters. The default sort for ordered lists is manual.

**Unordered lists** sort books automatically by criteria like title, author, or when they were added. You can change the sort at any time and save it as the list's default.

Available sort options for unordered lists:

- Recently added / Oldest added
- Title A–Z / Z–A
- Author A–Z / Z–A

## Adding Books

There are several ways to add books to a list:

- **From a book's detail page** — Use the "Add to List" action to select which lists the book belongs to
- **From bulk selection** — Select multiple books in a library view and use the "Add to List" toolbar button
- **From the list itself** — Use the add button on the list detail page

Books from any library can be added to the same list.

## Reordering

In ordered lists, you can reorder books by dragging them to a new position. For paginated lists where the target position is on a different page, use the "Move to Position" option to specify an exact position number.

## Sharing

Lists can be shared with other users at three permission levels:

| Permission | Can View | Can Add/Remove Books | Can Edit List | Can Share |
|------------|----------|----------------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Viewer** | Yes | | | |
| **Editor** | Yes | Yes | | |
| **Manager** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

The list owner always has full control, including the ability to delete the list.

Shared lists show attribution for who added each book, so collaborators can see each other's contributions.

### Library Access Filtering

When viewing a shared list, you only see books from libraries you have access to. If a book is in a library you can't access, it's hidden from your view — but it isn't removed from the list. If you later gain access to that library, the book reappears.

## Switching Between Ordered and Unordered

You can convert an existing list between ordered and unordered at any time:

- **Switching to ordered** assigns positions to all books based on when they were added (oldest first) and sets the sort to manual
- **Switching to unordered** clears all positions and sets the sort to recently added
