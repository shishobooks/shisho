# Directory Structure

Shisho works best when each book has its own directory. All editions of a book (EPUB, M4B, PDF, CBZ, etc.) should live in the same directory.

## Recommended Structure

```
/media/
└── Main Library/
    ├── [Andy Weir] Project Hail Mary/
    │   ├── Project Hail Mary.epub
    │   ├── Project Hail Mary.epub.cover.jpeg
    │   ├── Project Hail Mary {Ray Porter}.m4b
    │   └── Project Hail Mary {Ray Porter}.m4b.cover.png
    ├── [Andy Weir] The Martian/
    │   └── The Martian.epub
    ├── [Brian K. Vaughan] Saga Vol 1/
    │   └── Saga Vol 1.cbz
    └── [James Clear] Atomic Habits/
        ├── Atomic Habits.epub
        └── Supplement.pdf
```

## Organize Files

Shisho includes an optional "Organize Files" feature in library settings that can automatically organize your books into a consistent directory structure. When enabled, Shisho will move and rename files based on metadata.

If you prefer to manage your own file organization, you can leave this disabled and Shisho will work with whatever structure you have.
